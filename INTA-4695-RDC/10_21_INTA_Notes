U.S.-China Rivalry
Fei-Ling Wang, Professor of International Affairs (Georgia Institute of Technology)

China and America
    No fundamental conflicts between the two peoples
    Highly complementary economic interations
        Other than usual trade and frictions and cultural differences
    Great potential for working together to better the world
    Can they co-exist peacefully, cooperate, and co-prosper - "live and let live?"
        Not with the CCP-led PRC
        Chinese national interest v. CCP's political interest
    
The PRC and the USA
    Structural and genetic mismatches and incompatibilities:
        norms and values - two mutually exclusive ways of organizing people
        order and leadership - two alternative ways or organizing the world
    An existential rivalry since 1949
        often ignored or dismissed or wished away by US leaders
        but the CCP has always played its big game
            hides and retreats only when it fails or feels weak
        no matter what the US does or does do to/for China
            unless the US capitulates
