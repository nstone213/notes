U.S.-China Rivalry
Fei-Ling Wang, Professor of International Affairs (Georgia Institute of Technology)

China and America
    No fundamental conflicts between the two peoples
    Highly complementary economic interations
        Other than usual trade and frictions and cultural differences
    Great potential for working together to better the world
    Can they co-exist peacefully, cooperate, and co-prosper - "live and let live?"
        Not with the CCP-led PRC
        Chinese national interest v. CCP's political interest
    
The PRC and the USA
    Structural and genetic mismatches and incompatibilities:
        norms and values - two mutually exclusive ways of organizing people
        order and leadership - two alternative ways or organizing the world
    An existential rivalry since 1949
        often ignored or dismissed or wished away by US leaders
        but the CCP has always played its big game
            hides and retreats only when it fails or feels weak
        no matter what the US does or does do to/for China
            unless the US capitulates

What does the CCP-PRC want?
    Minimum: to secure its autocratic regime at home and in the world
        at the expense of democratic rule of law everywhere
            it "must" resist, reduce, replace the US power and leadership
                whenever and wherever possible
    Maximum: to recenter and reorder the world
        to replace the Westphalian world with a world empire of either 
            world communism 
            communiity of common destiny
            or rejuvination of the imperial China Order

The China Race - the Big Game
    A zero- or near-zero sum game for survival - asymmetrical payoffs
        the CCP-PRC political system, but not the Chinese statehood or nationhood
        the US/Western political system AND the American statehood even nationhood

    Increasingly a global rivalry
        with some non-zero-sum competition

    Think space exploration, green technology
