Particle Filters:
    Represent a probability density function as a set of weighted samples.
    The weighted samples are:
        pushed through the motion model (including uncertainty)
        reweighted based on sensor measurements (using the sensor model)
        resampled using the new weighted  to define a probability distribution on the sample set.

        the approach is easy to implement, and has low computational overhead.
        complexity does not grow exponentially with dimension of the state space.

    Two localization problems
        "Global" localization
            figure out where the robot is, but we don't know where the robot started
            sometimes called the "kidnapped robot problem"

        Position tracking
            figured out where the robot is, given that we know where the robot stated.

    Sampling to approximate densities
        densities can become arbitrarily complex, even when noise models are gaussian.
        one issue is nonlinear measurement and noise models
        a second issue is the curse of dimensionality (for grid-based methods)

        one way out: Sampling
    
    Represent p(x) by set of N weighted, random samples, called particles, of the form: < (xi, yi), wi >
        (xi, yi) represents robot's pose
        wi represents a weight, where the sum of wi = 1
    A.K.A. Monte Carlo Localization (MCL)
        Refers to techniques that are stochastic (random/non-deterministic)
        Used in many modeling and simulation approaches
